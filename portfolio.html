            <h2>Project 1</h2>
            <p>"Designing a Static Amazon Interface: Frontend Development with HTML & CSS"</p>
            <br>
            <p>In this project, I developed a static version of the Amazon e-commerce interface using HTML and CSS. The
                goal
                was to meticulously replicate the layout and design of Amazon’s website, including the homepage, product
                pages, and navigation elements. This project allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML for
                structuring content and CSS for styling and layout. The result is a clean, visually consistent
                representation of Amazon’s interface, showcasing my skills in frontend web design and attention to
                detail.
            </p>
            <h2>Project 2</h2>
            <br>
            <p>"Interior Elegance: A Static Webpage for Showcasing Design Projects"</p>
            <p>In this project, I created a visually appealing and informative static webpage to showcase interior
                design
                concepts. The webpage features a clean and modern design, highlighting various interior design projects
                with
                a focus on aesthetics and functionality. Using HTML and CSS, I designed the layout to effectively
                present
                design portfolios, client testimonials, and service offerings. This project demonstrates my ability to
                craft
                engaging and stylish web pages, with a keen eye for detail and a commitment to creating a user-friendly
                experience.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I am a third-year student pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Sagi Rama
                Krishnam Raju Engineering College. While my academic focus is on AI and data science, my passion lies in
                web development. I have developed a strong foundation in frontend technologies, including HTML, CSS, and
                basic JavaScript. I have also gained experience with Bootstrap and am currently expanding my skill set
                by learning React.js.

                Beyond my academic and technical interests, I have a deep enthusiasm for dance. I have actively
                participated in and performed at numerous dance events in my college. This creative outlet has enhanced
                my teamwork and presentation skills, and it complements my technical abilities by fostering a
                well-rounded approach to problem-solving and design.

                I am excited to leverage my web development skills and creativity to build engaging and user-friendly
                web experiences, and I look forward to exploring opportunities where I can combine my technical and
                artistic talents.
